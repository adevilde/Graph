# Graph project: Epidemic spreading

## Introduction

As you know, a new epidemic has overwhelmed the world, COVID-19 jeopardizes people and changes our habits. It is easy to realise that knowing how illnesses spread is vital to our own protection. How can we predict whether a disease will cause an epidemic, how many people it will infect, which people it will infect, and whether or not it is dangerous to society as a whole ? Also, how can we determine which techniques to use in fighting an epidemic once it begins ? One way to answer all of these questions is through mathematical modeling.

In this work you will have to review different epidemic modelings relying all on the representation by graphs of a human network called a contact network. A vertex in a contact network represents an individual and an edge between two vertices represents a contact between two individuals. The disease only spread from individual to individual if they are in contact, so through the edges. This representation is actually really common in research, and a lot of state-of-the-art modeling are built over it. From these different models you will be asked to draw conclusions from experiments on varying contact networks
